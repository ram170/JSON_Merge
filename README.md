# JSON_Merge
Code of JSON_Merge problem of Freshworks' initial screening process.

Merge complexity depends on the number of json files. But the complexity per json file is o(n) where n is the number of key-value pairs.

Path should be given in this format: Drive:\folder or Drive:/folder
Feedback about the code is appreciated.
